lapply apply a function to a list "l(ist)apply", returns a list

sapply tries to s(implify) lapply results

apply evaluate a function over the margins of an array

mapply apply function give multiple arguments ie mapply(rep, 1:4, 4:1)
	vecotrize functions.

vapply

sapply(split(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl), mean)

with(mtcars, tapply(mpg, cyl, mean))

tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)

<<- operator which can be used to assign a value to an object in an environment 	that is different from the current environment

	The operators <<- and ->> are normally only used in functions, and
	cause a search to be made through parent environments for an existing
	definition of the variable being assigned. If such a variable is found
	(and its binding is not locked) then its value is redefined, otherwise
	assignment takes place in the global environment.

	"The Evil and Wrong use is to modify variables in the global 
	environment."
